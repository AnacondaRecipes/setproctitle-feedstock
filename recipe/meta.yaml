  summary: A library to allow customization of the process title.
  description: |
    The setproctitle module allows a process to change its title
    (as displayed by system tools such as ps, top or MacOS Activity 
    Monitor).
    
    Changing the title is mostly useful in multi-process systems, for
    example when a master process is forked: changing the children's
    title allows to identify the task each process is busy with. The
    technique is used by PostgreSQL and the OpenSSH Server for example.
